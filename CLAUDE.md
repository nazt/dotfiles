## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for an AI assistant working on any software development project. It establishes safe, efficient, and well-documented workflows to ensure high-quality contributions.

### Key Responsibilities
-   Code development and implementation
-   Testing and quality assurance
-   Documentation and session retrospectives
-   Following safe and efficient development workflows
-   Maintaining project context and history

### Quick Reference - Short Codes
#### Context & Planning Workflow (Core Pattern)
-   `ccc` - Create context issue and compact the conversation.
-   `nnn` - Smart planning: Auto-runs `ccc` if no recent context ‚Üí Create a detailed implementation plan.
-   `gogogo` - Execute the most recent plan issue step-by-step.

#### Project Management
-   `rrr` - Create a detailed session retrospective.


## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Check required tools (customize for your project)
node --version
python --version
git --version
gh --version      # GitHub CLI
tmux --version    # Terminal multiplexer
```

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]

# 2. Install dependencies
# (e.g., pnpm install, npm install, pip install -r requirements.txt)
[package-manager] install

# 3. Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with required values

# 4. Setup tmux development environment
# Use short code 'sss' for automated setup
```

### First Task
1.  Run `lll` to see the current project status.
2.  Run `nnn` to analyze the latest issue and create a plan.
3.  Use `gogogo` to implement the plan.

## Project Context

*(This section should be filled out for each specific project)*

### Project Overview
Personal dotfiles repository forked/inspired by mathiasbynens/dotfiles, containing custom configurations for development environment setup including Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh, and various shell configurations.

### Architecture
-   **Backend**: [Framework, Language, Database]
-   **Frontend**: [Framework, Language, Libraries]
-   **Infrastructure**: [Hosting, CI/CD, etc.]
-   **Key Libraries**: [List of major dependencies]

### Current Features
-   [Feature A]
-   [Feature B]
-   [Feature C]

## üî¥ Critical Safety Rules

### Command Usage
-   **NEVER use `-f` or `--force` flags with any commands.**
-   Always use safe, non-destructive command options.
-   If a command requires confirmation, handle it appropriately without forcing.

### Git Operations
-   Never use `git push --force` or `git push -f`.
-   Never use `git checkout -f`.
-   Never use `git clean -f`.
-   Always use safe git operations that preserve history.
-   **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER MERGE PULL REQUESTS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
-   **Never use `gh pr merge` unless explicitly instructed by the user**
-   **Always wait for user review and approval before any merge**

### File Operations
-   Never use `rm -rf` - use `rm -i` for interactive confirmation.
-   Always confirm before deleting files.
-   Use safe file operations that can be reversed.

### Package Manager Operations
-   Never use `[package-manager] install --force`.
-   Never use `[package-manager] update` without specifying packages.
-   Always review lockfile changes before committing.

### General Safety Guidelines
-   Prioritize safety and reversibility in all operations.
-   Ask for confirmation when performing potentially destructive actions.
-   Explain the implications of commands before executing them.
-   Use verbose options to show what commands are doing.

## Development Environment



### Environment Variables
*(This section should be customized for the project)*

#### Backend (.env)
```
DATABASE_URL=
API_KEY=
```

#### Frontend (.env)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
```

## Development Workflows

### Testing Discipline

#### Automated Tests

#### Manual Testing Checklist
Before pushing any changes:
-   [ ] Run the build command successfully.
-   [ ] Verify there are no new build warnings or type errors.
-   [ ] Test all affected pages and features.
-   [ ] Check the browser console for errors.
-   [ ] Test for mobile responsiveness if applicable.
-   [ ] Verify all interactive features work as expected.

### GitHub Workflow

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REPOSITORY NOTICE:**
- **This repository**: `nazt/dotfiles` (YOUR repository)
- **Upstream repository**: `mathiasbynens/dotfiles` (READ-ONLY reference)
- **ALL `gh` commands MUST use `--repo nazt/dotfiles` to ensure issues/PRs are created in the correct repository**
- **NEVER create issues or PRs in the upstream repository**

#### Creating Issues
When starting a new feature or bug fix:
```bash
# 1. Update main branch
git checkout main && git pull

# 2. Create a detailed issue IN YOUR REPOSITORY
gh issue create --repo nazt/dotfiles --title "feat: Descriptive title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Overview
Brief description of the feature/bug.

## Current State
What exists now.

## Proposed Solution
What should be implemented.

## Technical Details
- Components affected
- Implementation approach

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific testable criteria
- [ ] Performance requirements
- [ ] UI/UX requirements
EOF
)"
```

#### Standard Development Flow
```bash
# 1. Create a branch from the issue
git checkout -b feat/issue-number-description

# 2. Make changes
# ... implement feature ...

# 3. Test thoroughly
# Use 'ttt' short code for the full test suite

# 4. Commit with a descriptive message
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Brief description

- What: Specific changes made
- Why: Motivation for the changes
- Impact: What this affects

Closes #issue-number"

# 5. Push and create a Pull Request IN YOUR REPOSITORY
git push -u origin branch-name
gh pr create --repo nazt/dotfiles --title "Same as commit" --body "Fixes #issue_number"

# 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER MERGE PRs YOURSELF
# DO NOT use: gh pr merge
# DO NOT use: Any merge commands
# ONLY provide the PR link to the user
# WAIT for explicit user instruction to merge
# The user will review and merge when ready
```

## Context Management & Short Codes

### Why the Two-Issue Pattern?
The `ccc` ‚Üí `nnn` workflow uses a two-issue pattern:
1.  **Context Issues** (`ccc`): Preserve session state and context.
2.  **Task Issues** (`nnn`): Contain actual implementation plans.

This separation ensures a clear distinction between context dumps and actionable tasks, leading to better organization and cleaner task tracking. `nnn` intelligently checks for a recent context issue and creates one if it's missing.

### Core Short Codes

#### `ccc` - Create Context & Compact
**Purpose**: Save the current session state and context to forward to another task.

1.  **Gather Information**: `git status --porcelain`, `git log --oneline -5`
2.  **Create GitHub Context Issue IN YOUR REPOSITORY**: Use `gh issue create --repo nazt/dotfiles` with a detailed template to capture the current state, changed files, key discoveries, and next steps.
3.  **Compact Conversation**: `/compact`

#### `nnn` - Next Task Planning (Analysis & Planning Only)
**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive implementation plan based on gathered context. **NO CODING** - only research, analysis, and planning.

1.  **Check for Recent Context**: If none exists, run `ccc` first.
2.  **Gather All Context**: Analyze the most recent context issue or the specified issue (`nnn #123`) from YOUR repository.
3.  **Deep Analysis**: Read context, analyze the codebase, research patterns, and identify all affected components.
4.  **Create Comprehensive Plan Issue IN YOUR REPOSITORY**: Use `gh issue create --repo nazt/dotfiles` with a detailed template to outline the problem, research, proposed solution, implementation steps, risks, and success criteria.
5.  **Provide Summary**: Briefly summarize the analysis and the issue number created.

#### `lll` - List Project Status
When you see `lll`, execute relevant `gh` and `git` commands (using `--repo nazt/dotfiles` for all gh commands) in parallel to get a full overview of the project's state, then provide a visual summary of open issues, recent PRs, and current focus.

#### `rrr` - Retrospective
**Purpose**: Document the session's activities, learnings, and outcomes.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: The AI Diary and Honest Feedback sections are MANDATORY. These provide essential context and continuous improvement insights. Never skip these sections.

1.  **Gather Session Data**: `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`, `git log --oneline main...HEAD`, and session timestamps.
2.  **Create Retrospective Document**: Use the template to create a markdown file in `retrospectives/` with ALL required sections, especially:
    - **AI Diary**: First-person narrative of the session experience
    - **Honest Feedback**: Frank assessment of what worked and what didn't
3.  **Validate Completeness**: Use the retrospective validation checklist to ensure no sections are skipped.
4.  **Update CLAUDE.md**: Copy any new lessons learned to the main guidelines.
5.  **Link to GitHub**: Commit the retrospective and comment on the relevant issue/PR.

**Time Zone Note**:
-   **PRIMARY TIME ZONE: [Your Time Zone]** - Always show the primary time zone first.
-   UTC time can be included for reference (e.g., in parentheses).
-   Filenames may use UTC for technical consistency.


**Step 3: Create Retrospective Document**
```bash
# Get session date and times
SESSION_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
END_TIME_UTC=$(date -u +"%H:%M")
END_TIME_LOCAL=$(TZ='Asia/Bangkok' date +"%H:%M")

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p retrospectives/$(date +%Y/%m)

# Create retrospective file with auto-filled date/time
cat > retrospectives/$(date +%Y/%m)/${SESSION_DATE}_${END_TIME_UTC//:/-}_retrospective.md << EOF
# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: ${SESSION_DATE}
**Start Time**: [FILL_START_TIME] GMT+7 ([FILL_START_TIME] UTC)
**End Time**: ${END_TIME_LOCAL} GMT+7 (${END_TIME_UTC} UTC)
**Duration**: ~X minutes
**Primary Focus**: Brief description
**Session Type**: [Feature Development | Bug Fix | Research | Refactoring]
**Current Issue**: #XXX
**Last PR**: #XXX
**Export**: retrospectives/exports/session_${SESSION_DATE}_${END_TIME_UTC//:/-}.md

## Technical Reference

*(This section should be filled out for each specific project)*

### Available Tools

#### Version Control
```bash
# Git operations (safe only)
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push origin branch

# GitHub CLI (ALWAYS specify YOUR repository)
gh issue create --repo nazt/dotfiles
gh pr create --repo nazt/dotfiles
```

#### Search and Analysis
```bash
# Ripgrep (preferred over grep)
rg "pattern" --type [file-extension]

# Find files
fd "[pattern]"
```

## Development Practices

### Code Standards
-   Follow the established style guide for the language/framework.
-   Enable strict mode and linting where possible.
-   Write clear, self-documenting code and add comments where necessary.
-   Avoid `any` or other weak types in strongly-typed languages.

### Git Commit Format
```
[type]: [brief description]

- What: [specific changes]
- Why: [motivation]
- Impact: [affected areas]

Closes #[issue-number]
```
**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Error Handling Patterns
-   Use `try/catch` blocks for operations that might fail.
-   Provide descriptive error messages.
-   Implement graceful fallbacks in the UI.
-   Use custom error types where appropriate.

## Lessons Learned

*(This section should be continuously updated with project-specific findings)*

### PocketBase JSVM Quirks (2025-08-24)
-   **Function Scoping**: Functions defined at top level in .pb.js files are NOT accessible in hook handlers - define functions INSIDE the hook handler
-   **VM Isolation**: PocketBase uses separate VMs - "loader" VM for .pb.js files, "executor" VMs for hook execution  
-   **No Timer Functions**: setTimeout, setInterval not available in JSVM - execute code directly
-   **Hook Availability**: onBootstrap is global, but onServe must be accessed via $app.onServe()
-   **API Signatures**: findFirstRecordByFilter doesn't support sorting - use findRecordsByFilter with limit 1
-   **Error Handling**: findFirstRecordByFilter throws "sql: no rows" when no record found - this is expected, wrap in try-catch

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
-   **Skipping AI Diary and Honest Feedback in retrospectives** - These sections provide crucial context and self-reflection that technical documentation alone cannot capture
-   **Assuming standard Node.js environment in PocketBase JSVM** - It's Goja (Go's JS engine) with limitations
-   **Defining functions at top level expecting them to be accessible in hooks** - They won't be due to VM isolation
-   *Example: Forgetting to update a lockfile after changing dependencies.*
-   *Example: Not checking build logs for warnings that could become errors.*
-   *Example: Making assumptions about API responses instead of checking the spec.*

### Useful Tricks Discovered
-   *Example: Using a specific library feature to simplify complex state.*
-   *Example: A shell command alias that speeds up a common task.*
-   *Example: A design pattern that solved a recurring problem in the codebase.*

### Session Learnings (2025-08-29)
-   **Pattern**: When creating multi-line content for a shell command, it's more reliable to write the content to a temporary file and pass the file path to the command.
-   **Mistake**: Forgetting to provide the user with a link to a created resource.
-   **Discovery**: The `gh` CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with GitHub, but it needs to be used carefully to avoid security restrictions.

### PocketBase JavaScript API Patterns (2025-08-29)
-   **Pattern**: Use `e.requestInfo()` to access parsed request data in JavaScript hooks - NOT `e.request.body()`
-   **Discovery**: `toString(e.request.body)` is a global helper function for reading raw body as string
-   **Pattern**: Request headers are accessible via `info.headers` with snake_case keys (e.g., `content_type`)
-   **Mistake**: Assuming JavaScript API mirrors typical HTTP request patterns - PocketBase has its own API design
-   **Discovery**: The request body in `e.request.body` is a Go `io.ReadCloser` interface, not directly readable in JS
-   **Pattern**: Always check framework source code FIRST when debugging API issues, not as last resort

### Project-Specific Patterns
-   *Example: The standard way we handle authentication state.*
-   *Example: The required structure for a new API endpoint.*
-   *Example: The component composition pattern used for UI elements.*

### User Preferences (Observed)
-   *Example: Prefers simple, direct solutions over complex abstractions.*
-   *Example: Values quick iteration and seeing visual progress.*
-   *Example: Appreciates clear, actionable feedback and well-defined tasks.*
-   **Time zone preference: [User's Time Zone]**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check for type errors or syntax issues
[build-command] 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "error"

# Clear cache and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules .cache dist build
[package-manager] install
```

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Find the process using a specific port
lsof -i :[port-number]

# Kill the process
kill -9 [PID]
```
